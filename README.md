Team-11 Project — Speakers Section
Description
This is a collaborative project by Team-11. My part in this project was to create the "Speakers" webpage using HTML and CSS. 
I designed a section where we can clearly display five speakers with their names, photos, and the topics they will present at the event.

The goal was to design the webpage beautifully and also manage all the code using Git and GitHub with multiple branches.
